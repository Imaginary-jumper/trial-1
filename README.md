# trial-1
learning.py (odd or even test) : first it takes a input in the form of an integer , however i coudnt figure how to deal with the problem if the user inputs a string like "k" instead of an integer , it will process the integer if the reminder of the integer after dividing it with 2 is 0 then its even other wise odd.

learning2.py : first i assinged 0 as a valie to a then made a loop it will run from 1 to 50 and every time it will keep on adding to a at the end when the loop ends it will print a.
